On October 20, 1819 he signed a land patent for 160 acres in the northwest corner of section 3, township 17, range 6 for assumed price of \\$320. Sometime between 1824-1827, the Pore's migrated from Westmoreland County in Pennsylvania to the farm near Paris, Ohio in Stark County.\n\nOn December 12, 1833, George's daughter, Elizabeth married a gentleman by the name of Phillip Walker, Dan's 3rd great grandfather. In the early 1820's, Phillip had also migrated to the Paris area from Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The newly weds settled on the farm and started a family. Following George's death and an inheritance dispute, Phillip and Elizabeth purchased 80 acres on the eastern half of the farm from Christopher Pore, a son of George's for \\$1500 in Oct. 1843. In the year prior to this purchase, they built the house and barn that are still standing and in use today on the farm.\n\nPhillip farmed until his death in 1898. During that time, he had remarried twice and had 10 children. In October 1899, his son Jacob H. Walker from his second marriage (Dan's great-great grandfather) inherited and/or purchased from his siblings these 80 acres for \\$4000.\n\n![](images/barn-01.jpg){width=\"365\"}\n\n##### *Barn-circa 1912*\n\nDuring his lifetime, Jacob married twice (Clara Mong and Cordelia Snyder) and had 4 children. Like his father, he farmed until his death in 1928. At that time, his sons Homer and Lloyd inherited the farm and in turn Homer sold his share to Lloyd for \\$1700 in August 1928.\n\nLloyd married Mabel Vandegrift (Dan's great grandparents) and they had 4 children that they raised on the farm like the generations before them. Lloyd farmed until his death in 1991 at which time Mabel and his son Olen (Dan's grandpa), took over. Mabel maintained ownership of the farm until her death in 2008 and then Olen purchased his siblings' shares of the inheritance to keep the farm together. With the exception of approximately 3 acres that were deeded off for houses for 2 of Lloyd's children, 77 acres continue today as part of the original farm.\n\nIn 2002, Dan and Sonia began the process of taking over the management and ownership of the farm from Olen. With the assistance of our teenage children, Leeann, Payton, and Andrew, we are still running the farm today. Although now in his 90's, Olen can be found around the farm from time to time checking up on his grand kids and/or great-grand kids or riding on his 1948 Massey Ferguson 30 tractor.\n\n## **The Farm**\n\n### *The early years and previous generations*\n\nThe farm has seen many changes in its 200 year history. The earliest generations grew and sold wheat, oats, hay, corn and potatoes and raised dairy cattle and hogs. In the late 1800's there was even a coal mine operating under the farm.\n\nLloyd continued to farm the land and milk cows. In the 1950's, with the regulations changing in handling and storing milk, he made the decision to stop milking dairy cows. For a brief period, Lloyd and his family tried raising pigs before purchasing the farm's first Black Angus cattle in 1959. Lloyd and Mabel also raised and sold ducks and chickens.\n\nOlen and Lois, his wife, also continued to run the Angus beef herd and growing ear corn, wheat, hay and oats until Dan and Sonia started taking over.\n\n### *Today*\n\nWe continue to farm the land and raise the beef cattle herd. All of the farmland plus what is rented from neighbors is used for pasture or to grow almost 100% of the feed and bedding for our cattle. We raise ear corn and hay as the main components for their feed and wheat, oats, and corn for the straw and corn fodder to bed with. Soybeans, any extra corn and the wheat and oats are grown and sold to the markets.\n\nThe beef cattle herd is primarily Black Angus but with our children starting their own herds, it now includes Red Angus, Maine, and Simmental. The majority of the Black Angus cattle are either finished out for beef, kept as replacement heifers or sold off as feeder calves. The rest of the herd is primarily being raised to show and produce future show heifers and steers. The show cattle in our herd today are either calves from the show cows that we already own, some that we have purchased from other breeders, or are embryos that we have purchased and transferred into one of our cows.\n\nWith the exception of the few show heifers that have been purchased in recent years and the selling of the feeder calves or the occasional older cows, all our cattle spend their entire lives on the farm with us. We see them everyday from when they are born until they are sold or butchered. Many hours are spent getting the newborns to nurse off of the moms, feeding and walking amongst the cows, keeping everyone bedded, and keeping everyone alive and healthy to name a few tasks. Many of our cows are with us twelve to fifteen years and some even longer. We know their personalities, which ones love to be scratched behind the ears, who to be extra cautious around when they calve, who the best mothers are, which ones are sisters or grandmothers/mothers/daughter to each other or have story to tell about when they were born. And the cows know us. They come running if someone is walking the fence to switch pastures or if the loader is heading down the road to get a bale of hay or if someone comes out the door in the morning to push up feed or if they are being called and hear that bucket hitting the cement under the feed bin.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n![](images/house.jpg){width=\"529\"}\n\n##### *House-Circa 1912*\n\n## **Family History**\n\nIn 1819, George Pore (aka Poor or Pohr), traveled to the land office in Steubenville, Ohio.
