# The Walkers

### Dan & Sonia

As a young kid and teenager, Dan spent his time helping his great-grandpa, Lloyd, and grandpa, Olen, and their families on the farm. Dan has been working as a cattle AI technician for nearly 20 years.

Also coming from a long history of family farming, Sonia grew up on a hog farm and her parents came from dairy/beef cattle and crop operations that are still in the families. She completed her Associate's and Bachelor's degrees in Horticulture and has spent 20 plus years in vegetable production research at the Ohio State University-OARDC.

### Leeann, Payton & Andrew

All three of the kids share similar interests. They are active in 4-H and FFA, work at local dairy farms, and play in the band. There is some interest in sports as they have played softball or baseball over the years. The girls love to show their beef heifers and steers at the local and state levels and Andrew prefers to show dairy cows.
