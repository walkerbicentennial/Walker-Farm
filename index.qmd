On the Walker Bicentennial Farm, we raise beef and agronomy crops. This farm has been owned and operated by our family since 1819 and Dan and Sonia Walker and their three children are the 6th and 7th generations of the operation.

In 2023, Ohio's Department of Agriculture recognized our farm as a Bicentennial Farm in its Historical Family Farms Program.
